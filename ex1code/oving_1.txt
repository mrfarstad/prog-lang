• How do you plan your work?
- We discuss briefly which working hours fit our schedule. Then we try to coordinate our schedule for the best team cooperation.

• How do you distribute tasks?
- We discuss within the group which part of the task each member will focus on. Then the tasks will be distributed thereafter.

• How do you ensure that an effort is being made?
- Make sure that every group member has done the tasks they are assigned. If they have not completed their tasks, ask what hinders them
from completing them. Offer help and give motivation. Working in groups will ensure that the job gets done.

• What do you do if your cooperation does not work?
- Then we discuss better ways of communicating. We can also improve documentation of individual work which makes it easier for other
group member to read the code.
